Radial Velocity Follow-up Calculator
====================================

This repository contains python code to calculate the number of radial velocity measurements required to detect the semi-amplitude of a transiting exoplanet at a desired detection significance. These calculations can be performed in the general case of correlated RV noise and in the white noise limit which is less computationally expensive but is often not an accurate approximation to real empirical RV time-series. Calculations of the number of RV measurements and total observing time are useful for planning RV follow-up observations and how to distribute observing time among a set of targeted transiting planetary systems. Additionally, a web-based tool to perform equivalent calculations can be found `here <http://maestria.astro.umontreal.ca/rvfc/>`_. The model and calculator are described in detail in this `paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01263>`_.
